<h1> Test </h1>

<p> So here I will be testing the paragraph, I am not sure if this works.
So it does work which is really neat, I will try chainging color, but I think that is only in CSS.</p>
<ul> 
  <li> Using " color: red;" does not work </li>
  <li> But the listing function works which is pretty neat</li>
  <li> This is my "second" day of coding</li>
</ul>

<h6> hm... </h6> 

<h4>Trying more to get color with my knowledge</h4>

<font color="red"> Testing color again</font>
